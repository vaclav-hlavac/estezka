# E-stezka

**E-stezka** is a modern digital tool for the Czech Scouting "stezka" (personal development path).  
It allows scouts to clearly track their progress, complete tasks, and keep records of achievements – directly on their mobile device.  
Leaders can easily review, approve, and manage members of their troop or patrol.

## 📱 Mobile Application

The companion mobile application (Flutter), originally created as a master’s thesis at CTU FIT,  
is designed with simplicity in mind while keeping the concepts of the paper version of the scouting path.

- Scouts can complete tasks and request approvals.  
- Leaders can review and confirm progress.  
- The application is currently in the testing phase.  
- The codebase will be available in a separate repository: [estezka-app](https://github.com/your-org/estezka-app) *TODO*
